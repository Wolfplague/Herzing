	<main>
		<p>According to Erin El Issa and Bev O’shea, writers for the site Nerdwallet, The best way to start building credit is to first open a credit card. After your credit card is open, make reasonable purchases and pay your balances on time if not before the due date. Keep your credit utilization low and avoid having too many open new accounts open at once. Keep your accounts open as long as possible and finally, check your credit reports frequently for errors or discrepancies (2017).</p>
